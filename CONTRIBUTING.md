# Contributing to Open Facilitation Library

Facilitation patterns and experience reports from practitioners are what keep this library growing and valuable.

## Contributions are welcome 😍

The main point of interaction is our [Patterns Library page][patterns].

We also maintain a public [Community Board][board] to track pattern development and gather feedback.

> The official documentation language is English, as it serves as a bridge between our global facilitator community. However, patterns can be submitted in any language with an English translation.

## How to share patterns or report issues? 🙋‍♂️

* Open [a new submission][new]
  * Please **search existing patterns** first to avoid duplicates!
